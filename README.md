# CrowdSource-Data-Reviews-and-Events-Calender
This was my Masters project which consisted of two applications namely the Crowd Source Data reviews and the Events Calender.
LAMP(Linux, Apache, MySql and PHP) stack is used in this project. 

This was done by a group of 5 members.

# CrowdSource-Data-Reviews
1. This project provides a mechanism for the Spectrum to crowdsource reviews of large datasets to the public, with each volunteer reviewing a small piece of the whole dataset and indicating if they think that there is value in investigating further.
2. The application splits a huge dataset (say a CSV column of 9999999 rows) into a certain number of parts(assigned by user) and assigns it to different people who are interested in reviewing the dataset, thus reducing time and effort of journalists.
3. All types of CRUD operations are possible in the dataset.

# Events Calender
1. This application creates an event calendar for exciting events on and off campus.
2. The application can be modified so that the companies can use it. Have an event? Just upload it in the calender and everyone who has access to the calender will be able to view it!!

# Admin Module and History Pages
1. The Admin module is present so as to view the application from an admin perspective(like importing an event or a dataset)
2. The admin module is also used to add or delete other admins.
3. The history pages are to keep track of the accountablity of each admin.
